# Android BMI Computation App
## Android Java Programming Assignment 3 for CS 260 (Assigned 10/02/24)
### This program is an Android app that computes the user's BMI.

To use this program, download the folder and build the project in Android Studio v2024.1.2 (Koala feature drop) or later.

The program will ask the user for their height in feet and inches as well as their weight, 
then display their calculated BMI with a silly suggestion from my professor.

This demonstrates passing data between Android Activities as well as user input.
